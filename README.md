ChatGPT Limitations
---

**Objective**:
There are two different implementations of a memory game project found inside the following directories:
    - `memory-game-multiplayer`
    - `memory-game-responsive`

For each one, included in the `new_feature.md` file is a description of a problem or new feature that was attempted to be added to the project using ChatGPT. The `conversation.md` file contains the complete conversation history between the student and ChatGPT, including the development process leading up to the fully working project and the failed attempts to implement the final feature.

---

**Requirements**:

1. Review the `new_feature.md` file in each directory to understand the problem or new feature that was attempted to be added to the project using ChatGPT.
2. For each of the two directories, successfully implement the new feature or solve the problem described in the `new_feature.md` file. You may use ChatGPT to help you with this task, but expect that the process may not be straightforward.

**Criteria for Success**:

In the case of `memory-game-multiplayer`, the criteria for success is functionality -- it doesn't have to be pretty. 

In the case of `memory-game-responsive`, the feature is a design change, so the criteria for success is almost entirely aesthetics (but it should still function as normal). The feature should be implemented in a way that is visually appealing and responsive on all different screen sizes and aspect ratios.

**Submission**:

1. For each of the two directories, ensure that the new feature or problem described in the `new_feature.md` file has been successfully implemented or solved.
2. Add a brief description of the changes you made to a `working_feature.md` file in each directory.
3. Commit your changes and push your code to your GitHub Classroom repository.
